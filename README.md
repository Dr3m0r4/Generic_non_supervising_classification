# Generic non supervising classification

* Generic machine learning algorithm made for n-dimensionnal images
  * Non supervising classification
  * Using [CImg] for the images
  * Using [MLPack] for the Machine Learning part
  * CMake and G++ are used to compile the project
* You can use the launcher.sh file

## Content
In the main folder, you can find the file [launcher.sh], that allow you to compile and execute the main file.
### [src]
You can find there all the C++ files.
### [image]
It's the folder where you can usually find thes images used to compute. I didn't put them on GitHub due to the storage space. You can access to the images I firstly used [here][first_dataset]
### [build]
You can find there all the executables you need.
